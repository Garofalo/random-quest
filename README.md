## Project Name

Random Quest

## Project Description

MVP functionality will have the user create a character several traits, including character art that they can later see details on. Post MVP, the user will control any created character in a game that takes the user generated character information and "battles" random information from the app. The character is deleted upon defeat.

## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```j{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "rec9DqyH87HbLyNHI",
            "fields": {},
            "createdTime": "2021-12-01T21:08:20.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recUCbQI10Lb4al22",
            "fields": {
                "name": "Dingus",
                "attack": "Attacky",
                "defense": "defendy",
                "description": "he strong",
                "image": "https://picsum.photos/200/300"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-12-01T21:08:20.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "rechtLeNdECrXpnHw",
            "fields": {},
            "createdTime": "2021-12-01T21:08:20.000Z"
        }
